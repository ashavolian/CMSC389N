                Excerpts from the Inaugural Address by John F. Kennedy. He was referred to by
                his initials JFK, and was the thirty-fifth President of the United States,
                serving from 1961 until 1963.

            <p>
                In the long history of the world, only a few generations have been granted the
                role of defending freedom in its hour of maximum danger. I do not shank from
                this responsibility - I welcome it. I do not believe that any of us would
                exchange places with any other people or any other generation. The energy, the
                faith, the devotion which we bring to this endeavour will light our country and
                all who serve it -- and the glow from that fire can truly light the world.
            </p>

            <p>
                And so, my fellow Americans: ask not what your country can do for you - ask what
                you can do for your country.
            </p>

            <p>
                My fellow citizens of the world: ask not what America will do for you, but what
                together we can do for the freedom of man.
            </p>
