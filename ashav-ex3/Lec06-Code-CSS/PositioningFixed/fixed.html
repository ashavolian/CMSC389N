            The Department of Computer Science has course exemption examinations available
            for CMSC 131, 132 and 250 and 212.These examinations aid in determining the most
            appropriate initial placement of a student into CMSC courses at UMCP and cannot
            be used to receive credit (ie they are not credit-by-examinations). Prior to
            taking a particular CMSC course, a student must have all prerequisite courses on
            their UMCP transcript, or they must have passed the departmental exemption
            examination for the prerequisite course(s) in question.

        <p id="p2">
            A student is allowed to attempt the exemption examination for a particular
            course only once. Also, a student may not take a CMSC exemption exam once they
            have enrolled in a CMSC course here at UMCP - "enroll" is defined for purposes
            here as "having taken the course and attended it beyond the end of the schedule
            adjustment period". Typically an incoming student will take the exemption exam
            during their orientation. No sample exams are available and the contents of the
            exams may require writing code, tracing code, answering questions, solving
            problems... The exams are all paper exams and may last anywhere from 60 to 90
            minutes. Not all topics listed below may actually appear on each exam. There is
            no charge to take a CMSC exemption exam and only one exam may be taken during
            each testing date. Additionally it should be noted that introductory CMSC
            courses here at the Univ. of MD, College Park may require 5-7 substantial
            programming projects to be written independently by each student throughout the
            semester. Written exams, by their very nature, cannot fully assess ones
            capability to complete an electronic program which contains 100's ( to 1000's)
            of lines of code (100's for CMSC 131 projects, to 1000's for CMSC 212 projects).
            Students placing into CMSC 131, 132 or higher should be prepared to write
            computer programs on the order of several hundred lines of code (for the 1st 132
            project) or a thousand or so lines of code (for the 1st 212 project). If you
            have any questions after reviewing these webpages you may contact a CMSC advisor
            during any of the posted advising hours.
